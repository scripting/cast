## davecast package

### How to install

`npm install davecast`

#### Story

davecast is a websockets-based way to get instant notification of messages that emanate from my blog, linkblog feed, photos, cards and Frontier updates. On the backend is a customized River5 server. 

Right now this flow is available through Slack. You have to ask to be invited. But this flow is open to everyone with a Node.js installation. And it might be a prototype for other people's casts.

#### Hello world

There's a hello world app in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/cast/tree/master/examples/echo">examples folder</a>.
