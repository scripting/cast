## davecast package

### How to install

`npm install davecast`

### Story

davecast is a websockets-based way to get instant notification of messages that emanate from my <a href="http://scripting.com/">blog</a>, <a href="http://scripting.com/links.html">linkblog</a>, photos, cards and Frontier updates. On the backend is a customized <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> server. 

Until now this flow was only available <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/16/experimentingWithAPersonalTwitter.html">through Slack</a>. But now it's open to everyone with a Node.js installation through the davecast <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davecast">package</a>. And it might be a prototype for other people's casts.

### Hello world

There's a hello world app in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/cast/tree/master/examples/echo">examples folder</a>.
